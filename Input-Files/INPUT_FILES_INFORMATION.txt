1-wax_data_text.txt:
		Holds information for all the waxes on the market
		that are looked at in this recommendation system.

2a-2d:
		2a holds all of the ratings that I extracted from
		ski test data from several elite ski clubs. 2b - 2d
		are subsets of this for more quickly evaluating my
		program.	
2a-test_data_very_large.txt: 	840 test data points, 47 unique snows.
2b-test_data_large.txt:		336 test data points, 19 unique snows.
2c-test_data_medium.txt:	168 test data points, 9 unique snows.
2d-test_data_small.txt:		112 test data points, 7 unique snows.


3a-snow_in_1.txt:
		A snow that does not exist in the test data. Thus,
		my algorithm will predominantly use the
		k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN) method on similar snows.

3b-snow_in_2.txt:
		A snow that does exist in the test data for test
		data 2a-2c. Thus, my algorithm will use both the wax and snow
		versions of the kNN method.

3c-snow_in_3.txt:
		Another snow that does exist in the test data. Again
		for data 2a-2c.

3d-snow_in_4.txt:
		Another snow that does exist in the test data. This
		time for all 2a-2d.

3e-snow_in_5.txt:
		A snow that does not exist in the test data and is
		really cold!
